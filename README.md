# CMPT 370 Monke Business Project

## Purpose
To-do application with timer integration. 

## Description
This program allows the user to create to-do tasks through a GUI and enables the ability to track the amount of time spent on a task with a timer. A "TODO" application to help with scheduling and time tracking, used to assist developers/students. This application would be able to create assignments/projects that have a start and end date, that would be placed into a calendar. It also contains the ability to track the amount of time spent on a task with a timer. The recorded times would be compiled at the end of the month to show the time you spent on tasks.

## Visuals
